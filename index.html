        <h2>
          Giving myself a chance to change!
        </h2>
        <time>16 December 2021 18:30</time>

        <p>
          I read in a coach's article the following quote: "The fear that you feel when you think about job change is your ego trying to keep you safe and comfortable."
        </p>

        <p>
          But also in this same article, the coach wrote that "If you feel like you should try something new, trust those feelings. Just take the first step and see what is out there."
        </p>

        <p>And that is exactly what I am doing, trying to give myself a chance for a needed change in my career path, so, the starting point is this blog!</a>
